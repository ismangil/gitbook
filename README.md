# Building a 3D Printer

This book is my attempt at experimenting with several things at once: 3D Printing, hacking, writing an eBook using gitbook, learning Git, and whatever else.



In this book I will go through the journey of building a 3D printer. From selecting a design, sourcing the parts and actually building it.



The finished printer will be a reasonable quality device. It will not be the biggest or the fastest. It can be tweaked, upgraded, but it shouldn't need constant adjusting.
